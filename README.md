# Dog Park Finder iOS App

# Overview

I made this app so I can learn a bit more about iOS development, specifically how to use the map and location services. 
This app automatically finds the nearest dog parks to the user based on their GPS location.

# Development Environment
For this app I used Xcode and I used the StoryboardUI development scheme.
I used the programming language Swift for this project.

# Useful Websites

* [Apple MapKit docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mapkit/)

# Future Work

* Add a second screen that can provide directions to the dog parks.
* Allow users to type in their city if they don't want to use GPS.
